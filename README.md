-	Dagger2 = https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/dagger-android
-	Fragments = https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments

The goal of this task it to generate a working Android phone-based app (installable APK), that will take a finger drawing of a single digit as input and display the predicted number that was drawn to screen.
The Task
1.	Generate an Android app based on the boilerplate code attached.
2.	Add 3 displays to the app:

-	Finger drawing display.
-	Popup dialog displaying the number written.
3. When done, share your code via a GitHub link.
   â€¢	Evaluation criteria:
